Event = Change in state of an object.
clicking on a button, moving the mouse, entering a character through keyboard,selecting an item from list, scrolling the page

Event handling = Capture event, and decide what to do	

Source: On which event occurs
Listener: Which listens to this event and provides response

STORY
click -> event generated
-> event class object created, with info about source/event
-> event object forwarded to listener
-> method gets executed and returns


LISTENER must implement listener interface, so as we know what all functionalities it must provide

Callback methods = called when event comes in, by java internally. They link to listener interface functions
