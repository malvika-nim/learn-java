1) can't do something outside function, to perform action need to define function
2) can't see the frame. Need to setVisible: true
3) too small. fix size
4) added button.
5) but button is too big. lets small it. setting size is not hepling.
6) putting two buttons -> one on top of 
7) setting layout as null worked. Default was borderLayout. frame.add(new JButton("Okay"), BorderLayout.SOUTH); worked to add to south.
8) instead of creating an actionListener subclass, made the main class as ActionListener, as need to pass in objects to the listener. And listener needs to modify these.
