//Important points about threads
Java has multiple threads, but only one thread class


//solve dead lock 
//solve producerConsumer problem

class myThread extends Thread
- public void run()
- synchronised void startWait()
- synchronised void notice()
- setPriority()
	Thread t = Thread.currentThread()
  myThread t = new myThread();
  t.setName("Name");
  t.isAlive();
  t.start();
  t.join()
  t.getName()
	Thread.sleep(1000)
  t.getState()
  
      wait()
      notify()
  t.notice()
  t.getPriority()

	ThreadGroup tg = Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup()
	tg.activeCount()
  t.isInterrupted()
